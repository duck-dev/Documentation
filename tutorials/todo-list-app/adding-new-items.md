# Adding new Items

When we originally created the `TodoListView` we added an "Add an item" button. It's time now to make that button do something. When the button is clicked we want to replace the list of items with a new view which will allow the user to enter the description of a new item.

### Create the view <a id="create-the-view"></a>

We start by creating the view \(see [here](https://docs.avaloniaui.net/tutorials/todo-list-app/creating-a-view#create-the-usercontrol) for a refresher on how to create a `UserControl` using a template\):

Views/AddItemView.axaml

```markup
<UserControl xmlns="https://github.com/avaloniaui"
             xmlns:x="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml"
             xmlns:d="http://schemas.microsoft.com/expression/blend/2008"
             xmlns:mc="http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/markup-compatibility/2006"
             mc:Ignorable="d" d:DesignWidth="200" d:DesignHeight="300"
             x:Class="Todo.Views.AddItemView">
  <DockPanel>
    <Button DockPanel.Dock="Bottom">Cancel</Button>
    <Button DockPanel.Dock="Bottom">OK</Button>
    <TextBox AcceptsReturn="True"
             Text="{Binding Description}"
             Watermark="Enter your TODO"/>
  </DockPanel>
</UserControl>
```

This gives us a view which looks like this:

![The view](../../.gitbook/assets/adding-new-items-view.png)

The only new thing here is the `<TextBox>` control which is a control that allows a user to input text. We set three properties on it:

* `AcceptsReturn` creates a multi-line `TextBox`
* `Text` binds the text that is displayed in the `TextBox` to the `Description` property on the view model
* `Watermark` causes a placeholder to be displayed when the `TextBox` is empty

### Create the view model <a id="create-the-view-model"></a>

Our view model is going to start out _extremely_ simple. We're just going to provide the `Description` property that the `TextBox` is bound to for starters. We'll add to this as we go along.

ViewModels\AddItemViewModel.cs

```csharp
namespace Todo.ViewModels
{
    class AddItemViewModel : ViewModelBase
    {
        public string Description { get; set; }
    }
}
```

### Swap out the list view model <a id="swap-out-the-list-view-model"></a>

When we click the "Add an item" button, we want to stop showing the `TodoListView` in the window and show the `AddItemView`. We can alter the `MainWindowViewModel` to let us do this:

ViewModels/MainWindowViewModel.cs

```csharp
using ReactiveUI;
using Todo.Services;

namespace Todo.ViewModels
{
    class MainWindowViewModel : ViewModelBase
    {
        ViewModelBase content;

        public MainWindowViewModel(Database db)
        {
            Content = List = new TodoListViewModel(db.GetItems());
        }

        public ViewModelBase Content
        {
            get => content;
            private set => this.RaiseAndSetIfChanged(ref content, value);
        }

        public TodoListViewModel List { get; }

        public void AddItem()
        {
            Content = new AddItemViewModel();
        }
    }
}

```

Here we add a `Content` property which is initially set to our list view model. When the `AddItem()` method is called, we assign an `AddItemViewModel` to the `Content` property.

The `Content` property setter calls `RaiseAndSetIfChanged` which will cause [a change notification](https://docs.avaloniaui.net/docs/data-binding/change-notifications) to be fired each time the property changes value. Avalonia's binding system needs change notifications in order to know when to update the user-interface in response to a property change.

We now want to bind our `Window.Content` property to this new `Content` property instead of the `List` property that it is currently bound to:

Views/MainWindow.axaml

```markup
<Window xmlns="https://github.com/avaloniaui"
        xmlns:x="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml"
        x:Class="Todo.Views.MainWindow"
        Icon="/Assets/avalonia-logo.ico"
        Width="200" Height="300"
        Title="Avalonia Todo"
        Content="{Binding Content}">
</Window>
```

And finally we need to make the "Add an item" button call `MainWindowViewModel.AddItem()`.

Views/TodoListView.axaml

```markup
<UserControl xmlns="https://github.com/avaloniaui"
             xmlns:x="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml"
             xmlns:d="http://schemas.microsoft.com/expression/blend/2008"
             xmlns:mc="http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/markup-compatibility/2006"
             mc:Ignorable="d" d:DesignWidth="200" d:DesignHeight="300"
             x:Class="Todo.Views.TodoListView">
  <DockPanel>
    <Button DockPanel.Dock="Bottom"
            Command="{Binding $parent[Window].DataContext.AddItem}">
      Add an item
    </Button>
    <ItemsControl Items="{Binding Items}">
      <ItemsControl.ItemTemplate>
        <DataTemplate>
          <CheckBox Margin="4"
                    IsChecked="{Binding IsChecked}"
                    Content="{Binding Description}"/>
        </DataTemplate>
      </ItemsControl.ItemTemplate>
    </ItemsControl>
  </DockPanel>
</UserControl>
```

The binding we've added to `<Button>` is:

```markup
Command="{Binding $parent[Window].DataContext.AddItem}"
```

There are a few parts to this:

* The `Button.Command` property describes a command to be called when the button is clicked
* We're binding it to `$parent[Window].DataContext.AddItem`:
  * `$parent[Window]` means find an ancestor control of type `Window`
  * And get its `DataContext` \(i.e. a `MainWindowViewModel` in this case\)
  * And bind to the `AddItem` method on that view model

This will cause the `MainWindowViewModel.AddItem()` method to be invoked when the button is clicked.

If you're familiar with WPF or UWP you may think it strange that we're binding `Button.Command` to a method. This is a convenience feature of Avalonia which means that you don't have to create an `ICommand` for simple commands that are always enabled.

### Run the application <a id="run-the-application"></a>

If you now run the application and click the "Add an item" button you should see the new view appear.

![The running application](../../.gitbook/assets/adding-new-item-run.gif)

Now we have the "Add new item" view appearing we need to make it work. In particular we need to enable/disable the OK button depending on whether the user has typed anything in the `Description`.

### Implement the OK and Cancel commands <a id="implement-the-ok-and-cancel-commands"></a>

In the last section we bound a `Button.Command` to a method on the view model, but if we want to be able to control the enabled state of the button we need to bind to an [`ICommand`](https://docs.avaloniaui.net/docs/data-binding/binding-to-commands). Again we're going to take advantage of ReactiveUI and use [`ReactiveCommand`](https://reactiveui.net/docs/handbook/commands/).

ViewModels\AddItemViewModel.cs

```csharp
using System.Reactive;
using ReactiveUI;
using Todo.Models;

namespace Todo.ViewModels
{
    class AddItemViewModel : ViewModelBase
    {
        string description;

        public AddItemViewModel()
        {
            var okEnabled = this.WhenAnyValue(
                x => x.Description,
                x => !string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(x));

            Ok = ReactiveCommand.Create(
                () => new TodoItem { Description = Description }, 
                okEnabled);
            Cancel = ReactiveCommand.Create(() => { });
        }

        public string Description
        {
            get => description;
            set => this.RaiseAndSetIfChanged(ref description, value);
        }

        public ReactiveCommand<Unit, TodoItem> Ok { get; }
        public ReactiveCommand<Unit, Unit> Cancel { get; }
    }
}
```

First we modify the `Description` property to raise [change notifications](https://docs.avaloniaui.net/docs/data-binding/change-notifications). We [saw this pattern before](https://docs.avaloniaui.net/tutorials/todo-list-app/adding-new-items#swap-out-the-list-view-model) in the main window view model. In this case though, we're implementing change notifications for `ReactiveUI` rather than for Avalonia specifically:

```csharp
var okEnabled = this.WhenAnyValue(
    x => x.Description,
    x => !string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(x));
```

Now that `Description` has change notifications enabled we can use [`WhenAnyValue`](https://reactiveui.net/docs/handbook/when-any/) to convert the property into a stream of values in the form of an [`IObservable`](http://introtorx.com/Content/v1.0.10621.0/02_KeyTypes.html#KeyTypes).

This above code can be read as:

* For the initial value of `Description`, and for subsequent changes
* Select the inverse of the result of invoking `string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace()` with the value

This means that `okEnabled` represents a stream of `bool` values which will produce `true` when `Description` is a non-empty string and `false` when it is an empty string. This is exactly how we want the `OK` button to be enabled.

We then create a `ReactiveCommand` and assign it to the `Ok` property:

```csharp
Ok = ReactiveCommand.Create(
    () => new TodoItem { Description = Description }, 
    okEnabled);
```

The second parameter to `ReactiveCommand.Create` controls the enabled state of the command, and so the observable we just created is passed there.

The first parameter is a lambda that is run when the command is executed. Here we simply create an instance of our model `TodoItem` with the description entered by the user.

We also create a command for the "Cancel" button:

```csharp
Cancel = ReactiveCommand.Create(() => { });
```

The cancel command is always enabled so we don't pass an observable to control its state, we just pass an "execute" lambda which in this case does nothing.

### Bind the OK and Cancel buttons <a id="bind-the-ok-and-cancel-buttons"></a>

We can now bind the OK and Cancel buttons in the view to the `Ok` and `Cancel` commands we just created on the view model:

Views/AddItemView.axaml

```markup
<UserControl xmlns="https://github.com/avaloniaui"
             xmlns:x="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml"
             xmlns:d="http://schemas.microsoft.com/expression/blend/2008"
             xmlns:mc="http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/markup-compatibility/2006"
             mc:Ignorable="d" d:DesignWidth="200" d:DesignHeight="300"
             x:Class="Todo.Views.AddItemView">
  <DockPanel>
    <Button DockPanel.Dock="Bottom" Command="{Binding Cancel}">Cancel</Button>
    <Button DockPanel.Dock="Bottom" Command="{Binding Ok}">OK</Button>
    <TextBox AcceptsReturn="False"
             Text="{Binding Description}"
             Watermark="Enter your TODO"/>
  </DockPanel>
</UserControl>

```

If you run the application and go to the "Add Item" view you should now see that the OK button is only enabled when text has been entered in the description `TextBox`.

### Handle the OK and Cancel button <a id="handle-the-ok-and-cancel-button"></a>

We now need to react to the OK or Cancel buttons being pressed and re-show the list. If OK was pressed we also need to add the new item to the list. We'll implement this functionality in `MainWindowViewModel`:

ViewModels/MainWindowViewModel.cs

```csharp
using System;
using System.Reactive.Linq;
using ReactiveUI;
using Todo.Models;
using Todo.Services;

namespace Todo.ViewModels
{
    class MainWindowViewModel : ViewModelBase
    {
        ViewModelBase content;

        public MainWindowViewModel(Database db)
        {
            Content = List = new TodoListViewModel(db.GetItems());
        }

        public ViewModelBase Content
        {
            get => content;
            private set => this.RaiseAndSetIfChanged(ref content, value);
        }

        public TodoListViewModel List { get; }

        public void AddItem()
        {
            var vm = new AddItemViewModel();

            Observable.Merge(
                vm.Ok,
                vm.Cancel.Select(_ => (TodoItem)null))
                .Take(1)
                .Subscribe(model =>
                {
                    if (model != null)
                    {
                        List.Items.Add(model);
                    }

                    Content = List;
                });

            Content = vm;
        }
    }
}
```

There are a few parts to the added code:

```csharp
Observable.Merge(vm.Ok, vm.Cancel.Select(_ => (TodoItem)null))
```

This code takes advantage of the fact that `ReactiveCommand` is itself an observable which produces a value each time the command is executed. You'll notice than when we defined the commands they had slightly different declarations:

```csharp
public ReactiveCommand<Unit, TodoItem> Ok { get; }
public ReactiveCommand<Unit, Unit> Cancel { get; }
```

The second type parameter to `ReactiveCommand` specifies the type of result it produces when the command is executed. `Ok` produces a `TodoItem` while `Cancel` produces a `Unit`. `Unit` is the reactive version of `void`. It means the command produces no value.

[`Observable.Merge`](https://reactivex.io/documentation/operators/merge.html) combines the output from any number of obervables and merges them into a single observable stream. Because they're being merged into a single stream, they need to be of the same type. For this reason we call `vm.Cancel.Select(_ => (TodoItem)null)`: this has the effect that every time the `Cancel` observable produces a value we select a `null` `TodoItem`.

```csharp
.Take(1)
```

We're only interested in the first click of either the OK or Cancel button; once one of the buttons are clicked we don't need to listen for any more clicks. [`Take(1)`](https://reactivex.io/documentation/operators/take.html) means "just take the first value produced by the observable sequence".

```csharp
.Subscribe(model =>
{
    if (model != null)
    {
        List.Items.Add(model);
    }

    Content = List;
});
```

Finally we subscribe to the result of the observable sequence. If the command resulted in a `model` being produced \(i.e. OK was clicked\) then add this model to the list. We then set `Content` back to `List` in order to display the list in the window and hide the "AddItemView".
