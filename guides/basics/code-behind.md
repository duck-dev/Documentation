# Code-behind

[Window](https://docs.avaloniaui.net/docs/controls/window) and [UserControl](https://docs.avaloniaui.net/docs/controls/usercontrol) files also have an associated _code-behind_ file which usually has the extension `.xaml.cs` or `.axaml.cs` and may be displayed collapsed under the XAML file in your editor. Below you can see a `MainWindow.xaml` file along with its markdown file `MainWindow.xaml.cs` in Visual Studio:

![Code-behind in Visual Studio](../../.gitbook/assets/codebehind-vs.png)

The code-behind file by default defines a .NET class with the same name as your XAML file, e.g.

```csharp
using Avalonia;
using Avalonia.Controls;
using Avalonia.Markup.Xaml;

namespace AvaloniaApplication1
{
    public class MainWindow : Window
    {
        public MainWindow()
        {
            InitializeComponent();
#if DEBUG
            this.AttachDevTools();
#endif
        }

        private void InitializeComponent()
        {
            AvaloniaXamlLoader.Load(this);
        }
    }
}

```

Note that this class definition corresponds closely to the XAML file:

```markup
<Window xmlns="https://github.com/avaloniaui"
        xmlns:x="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml"
        x:Class="AvaloniaApplication1.MainWindow">
</Window>
```

* The base class, `Window` is the root element of the XAML file
* The `x:Class` attribute references the fully-qualified name of the class defined in code-behind

If you make any changes to the base class, namespace, or name of the class, make sure to update both the code-behind and the XAML to ensure they match.

In addition, the class contains two more things of interest:

* It enables [DevTools](https://docs.avaloniaui.net/docs/getting-started/developer-tools) in debug mode
* It defines an `InitializeComponent` method which is used to load the XAML at runtime

### Locating Controls <a id="locating-controls"></a>

One of the main uses of the code-behind file is to manipulate controls using C\# code. To do this you'll usually first want to get a reference to a named control. This can be done using the `FindControl<T>` method:

```markup
<Window xmlns="https://github.com/avaloniaui"
        xmlns:x="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml"
        x:Class="AvaloniaApplication4.MainWindow">
  <Button Name="myButton">Hello World</Button>
</Window>
```

```csharp
public class MainWindow : Window
{
    private Button myButton;

    public MainWindow()
    {
        InitializeComponent();
    }

    private void InitializeComponent()
    {
        AvaloniaXamlLoader.Load(this);
        myButton = this.FindControl<Button>("myButton");
    }
}
```

`FindControl` must be called after `AvaloniaXamlLoader.Load` has run because it's not until this point that the control will have been created.

This step is not necessary in WPF and UWP because they have a code-generation step which creates this code for you. Avalonia does not currently have such a step so you'll need to do it manually.

### Handling Events <a id="handling-events"></a>

Another common use for the code-behind file is to define _event handlers_. Event handlers are defined as methods in the code-behind and referenced from XAML. For example to add a handler for a button click:

```markup
<Window xmlns="https://github.com/avaloniaui"
        xmlns:x="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml"
        x:Class="AvaloniaApplication4.MainWindow">
  <Button Click="MyButton_Click">Hello World</Button>
</Window>
```

```csharp
public class MainWindow : Window
{
    public MainWindow()
    {
        InitializeComponent();
    }

    public void MyButton_Click(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e)
    {
        // Handle click here.
    }

    private void InitializeComponent()
    {
        AvaloniaXamlLoader.Load(this);
    }
}
```
